<h2> Abstract </h2>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  This package for <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a>&nbsp;4 provides implementations of algorithms and methods
  for computing in certain infinite permutation groups. These groups act on the set
  of integers or on the set of elements of another suitable ring:
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  Let <em>R</em> be a principal ideal domain.
  Given disjoint residue classes <em>r1</em>(<em>m1</em>) and <em>r2</em>(<em>m2</em>)
  of&nbsp;<em>R</em>, let the corresponding <em>class transposition</em> be the
  permutation of&nbsp;<em>R</em> which interchanges <em>r1</em>+<em>km1</em> and
  <em>r2</em>+<em>km2</em> for each&nbsp;<em>k</em> in&nbsp;<em>R</em> and which fixes
  all other points. Further let CT(<em>R</em>) be the group which is generated by the
  set of all class transpositions of&nbsp;<em>R</em>. 
  At least in case <em>R</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<b>Z</b> this group is simple.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  The RCWA package permits to compute in the group CT(<em>R</em>), where <em>R</em> is
  either the ring of integers or a univariate polynomial ring GF(<em>q</em>)[<em>x</em>]
  over a finite field. This means that in principle it allows to construct and investigate
  all finitely generated groups which embed into CT(<em>R</em>) for one of the mentioned
  rings&nbsp;<em>R</em>. For <em>R</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<b>Z</b>, this holds for the following
  groups and their subgroups:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Finite groups, and certain divisible torsion groups which they embed into. </li>
  <li> Free groups of finite rank. </li>
  <li> Free products of finitely many finite groups, thus in particular the
       modular group PSL(2,<b>Z</b>). </li>
  <li> Direct products of the above groups. </li>
  <li> Wreath products of the above groups with finite groups and with the infinite
       cyclic group (<b>Z</b>,+). </li>
  <li> Many, many further groups which are not listed here. </li>
</ul>

<p class = "normaltext">
  This list permits already to conclude that CT(<b>Z</b>) has finitely generated
  subgroups which do not have finite presentations, and such with algorithmically
  unsolvable membership problem.
  However the list is certainly by far not exhaustive, and using this package
  it is easy to construct groups falling into the last-mentioned category.
  For results on the group CT(<b>Z</b>), see the author's article

<h2> Requirements and Installation </h2>

<p class = "normaltext">
  RCWA can&nbsp;be used on any platform for which <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> is available.
  It requires only a recent <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> installation and the recent version of
  <a href = "resclasses.html">ResClasses</a>.
  For details see the <a href = "rcwa/README.rcwa">README</a> file.
  Like any other <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> package, RCWA is usually installed in the <code>pkg/</code>
  subdirectory of the <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> distribution. This is accomplished by extracting
  the distribution file in this directory. To load the package, enter
  <code>LoadPackage("rcwa");</code> at the <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> prompt.
