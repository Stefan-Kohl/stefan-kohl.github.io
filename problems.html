  Some Problems, Questions and Examples from Elementary&nbsp;Number&nbsp;Theory
</h1>

<p class = "normaltext">
  <em class = "introducingwords"> Conjecture: </em>
  Let <em>R</em> be an euclidean ring all of whose nontrivial residue class
  rings are finite. Further let <em>P</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>R</em>[<em>x</em>]
  be a univariate polynomial over&nbsp;<em>R</em> such that
  gcd{&nbsp;<em>P</em>(<em>x</em>)&nbsp;|&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>R</em>&nbsp;}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.
  Then there is an <em>x</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>R</em> such that <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>) has
  not more prime factors in&nbsp;<em>R</em> than the polynomial
  <em>P</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>R</em>[<em>x</em>].

  Let <em>n</em> be a Carmichael number with three prime factors, and let
  <em>p</em> be one of them. Then we have <em>n</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;4<em>p</em><sup>6</sup>
  (<a href = "problems/cmzth.pdf">proof</a>). 
  Using this upper bound, it can be verified by means of computation that
  <em>p</em> can be any odd prime number less than 1223, but not 1223 itself.
  There is a <a href = "problems/cm3fact.gap">GAP program</a> 
  and a <a href = "problems/cm3fakt.pas">Pascal program</a> for this.
  A precomputed table is available <a href = "problems/cm3fact.txt">here</a>.
  The numbers of Carmichael numbers with 3 prime factors having a specific factor
  <em>p</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;10000 are listed <a href = "problems/cmzno.txt">here</a>.
</p>

<p class = "normaltext">
  <em class = "introducingwords">Question:</em> Which primes are possible values of <em>p</em>?
</p>

<h2 align = "center"> 3. </h2>

<p class = "normaltext">
  Are there positive integers <em>a</em>,<em>b</em>&nbsp;>&nbsp;1
  such that <em>a</em><sup>&pi;</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>b</em>?
</p>

<p class = "normaltext">
  The existence of such numbers is implausible, but the
  transcendence of &pi; is obviously insufficient for a proof.
  Cf. <a href = "http://mathoverflow.net/questions/118523/" target = "_blank">this</a>
  question on MathOverflow.

<p class = "normaltext">
  Marking the rational points on the unit sphere
  (equation <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>+<em>y</em><sup>2</sup>+<em>z</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1)
  with common denominator less than a given upper bound and projecting
  one octant onto the plane <em>z</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 yields the following picture:
</p> 

<p>
  <a href = "images/sphere1.gif">
    <img src = "images/sphere1s.gif" width = "400" height = "400"
         alt = "A mathematical illustration" />
  </a>
</p>

<p class = "normaltext">
  Taking the equation
  <em>x</em><sup>3</sup>+<em>y</em><sup>3</sup>+<em>z</em><sup>3</sup> = 1
  instead yields the following picture:
</p>

<p>
  <img src = "images/sphere2.gif" width = "400" height = "400"
       alt = "A mathematical illustration" />
</p>

<p class = "normaltext">
  How does the respective image for the equation
  <em>x</em><sup>4</sup>+<em>y</em><sup>4</sup>+<em>z</em><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
  look like?
</p>

<p class = "normaltext">
  It is known that this equation has infinitely many solutions as well.
  The `minimal' solution is
  (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) = (95800/422481,217519/422481,414560/422481).

  Write down the sequence of positive integers in the following manner
  onto a square grid:

  Ulam's prime number spiral</a>). Then paint the squares in colors
  depending on the length of the period of the continued fraction expansion
  of the square root of&nbsp;<em>n</em>.
  This yields images like the following:
