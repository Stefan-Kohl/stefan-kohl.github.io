  <em class = "introducingwords">Conjecture:</em>
  Let <em>m</em> be an integer greater than&nbsp;2, and let <em>f</em> be a bijection from the set
  of prime residue classes (mod&nbsp;<em>m</em>) to the set&nbsp;<em>B</em> of the elements
  of the canonical basis of <b>Z</b><sup>&phi;(<em>m</em>)</sup> and their additive inverses.
  Then the mapping

</p>
<p>
  is surjective if and only if &phi;(<em>m</em>) is less than or equal to 4.
  Furthermore if it is surjective, then all preimages are infinite.
