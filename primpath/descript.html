  Prime Number Races in Multiple Dimensions - <br />
  Description of the Images  
</h1>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  The menu on the right provides access to graphical visualizations of
  some examples (for all <em>m</em> with &phi;(<em>m</em>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 except of
  <em>m</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, since this would be the same as for <em>m</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5).
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  These images strongly suggest a certain inhomogenity of the distribution of primes,
  in particular if one compares them with images created using sequences
  of pseudo - random numbers (I have tested this with various random number generators,
  and the result was essentially independent from the particular choice here).
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  For the given example of a randomized image, I&nbsp;have taken a sequence of
  &pi;(10000000) = 664579 random integers (this allows a direct comparison
  with the images above with <em>n</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;10000000)
  ranging from 0 to&nbsp;3 and associated them to the four coordinate directions
  of a two - dimensional cartesian coordinate system similar as above.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  The `diameter' of the figures created using the distribution of primes on
  the prime residue classes (mod&nbsp;<em>m</em>) seems to be significantly smaller
  than the statistically expected value concerning the randomly generated ones.
