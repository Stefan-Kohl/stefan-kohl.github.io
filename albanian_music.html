    Ema Qazimi: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGoWX52eQLY" target = "_blank"><em>Krenari e Brezave</em></a>
    <p class = "normaltext">
      A song about good times, full of beautiful lyrics to an amount which makes it basically untranslatable,
      and with an enormous spirit of pride and optimism.
      For this, Ema Qazimi got the first prize in the
      <a href = "http://festivali-rtsh.al/" target = "_blank"><em>Festivali i kenges ne RTSH</em></a>
      in&nbsp;1981.

    Rovena Stefa: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEU14XpnQYM" target = "_blank"><em>Rrofte shqipja dhe vatani</em></a>
    <p class = "normaltext">
      A song about bad times in the diaspora, and longing for home.
      Anyway a very nice song for dancing -- when I was in Vlora, at university parties this was frequently played
      as dancing music.
    </p>

    Vace Zela: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osFYt8k7lgk" target = "_blank"><em>Nene moj do pres gershetin</em></a>
    <p class = "normaltext">
      A very beautiful song -- of a bride who decides otherwise, cancels her wedding, and ... -- but listen yourself!
      For this, Vace Zela got the first prize in the
      <a href = "http://festivali-rtsh.al/" target = "_blank"><em>Festivali i kenges ne RTSH</em></a>
      in&nbsp;1976.

    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCPOiE2y5s" target = "_blank"><em>Kur mi zbrisje shkallet</em></a>
    <p class = "normaltext">
      Beautiful wedding song from southern Albania. Very nice for dancing.
      I heard it quite often when I was in Vlora.

    Marina Grabovari: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgNEV_Vex-A" target = "_blank"><em>Mesnate</em></a> 
    <p class = "normaltext">
      A WONDERFUL love song, from around&nbsp;1980.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Marina Grabovari: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPzDelHTU5w" target = "_blank"><em>Nje djep ne barrikade</em></a> 
    <p class = "firstparagraph">
      Another very nice song by the same artist as above, but about fighting in the streets of Tirana in World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II
      against the fashists. Unintentionally humoristic, or at least can be taken as such -- but listen yourself!
    </p>
    <p class = "lastparagraph">
      For this, Marina Grabovari got the first prize in the
      <a href = "http://festivali-rtsh.al/" target = "_blank"><em>Festivali i kenges ne RTSH</em></a>
      in&nbsp;1982, lost support by PPSH, was banned to a village and her career came to a sudden end.
