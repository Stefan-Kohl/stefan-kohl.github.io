    Ema Qazimi: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGoWX52eQLY" target = "_blank"><em>Krenari e Brezave</em></a>
    <p class = "normaltext">
      A song about good times, full of beautiful lyrics to an amount which makes it basically untranslatable,
      and with an enormous spirit of pride and optimism.
      For this, Ema Qazimi got the first prize in the <em>Festivali i kënges në Radiotelevizion</em> in&nbsp;1981.

    Rovena Stefa: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEU14XpnQYM" target = "_blank"><em>Rrofte shqipja dhe vatani</em></a>
    <p class = "normaltext">
      A song about bad times in the diaspora, and longing for home.
      Anyway a very nice song for dancing -- when I was in Vlora, at university parties this was frequently played
      as dancing music.

    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCPOiE2y5s" target = "_blank"><em>Kur mi zbrisje shkallët</em></a>
    <p class = "normaltext">
      Beautiful wedding song from southern Albania. Very nice for dancing.
      I heard it quite often when I was in Vlora.

    Marina Grabovari: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgNEV_Vex-A" target = "_blank"><em>Mesnatë</em></a> 
    <p class = "normaltext">
      A WONDERFUL love song, from around&nbsp;1980.

    Marina Grabovari: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPzDelHTU5w" target = "_blank"><em>Një djep në barrikadë</em></a> 
    <p class = "normaltext">
      A song by the same artist as above, but about fighting in the streets of Tirana in World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II
      against the fashists. 
      For this, Marina Grabovari got the first prize in the <em>Festivali i kënges në Radiotelevizion</em> in&nbsp;1982,
      lost support by the party, was banned to a village and her career came to a sudden end.
      (The imagery has likely been added much later for the YouTube video --
      except for those showing her singing, of course.)
