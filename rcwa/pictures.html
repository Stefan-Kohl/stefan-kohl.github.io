<h1 class = "other"> A Little RCWA Picture Gallery </h1>

<p class = "normaltext">
  This page shows a couple of pictures created using the function <code>DrawOrbitPicture</code>.
  This function is new in RCWA&nbsp;2.3.0. In order to save space, the pictures have been
  converted to PNG format by a common graphics program.
  The first picture shows an orbit under an action of the modular group PSL(2,Z)
  on&nbsp;Z&nbsp;x&nbsp;Z (the pattern of course extends to infinity):
</p>

<br />

<img src = "pictures/example1.png" width = "512" height = "512"
     alt = "An illustration of an orbit under a certain action of PSL(2,Z) on Z x Z" border = "0pt" />

<p class = "normaltext">
  The action of PSL(2,Z) on that orbit is regular(!).
  The picture is created by the following commands:
</p>

<pre>
gap> PSL2Z := Image(IsomorphismRcwaGroup(FreeProduct(CyclicGroup(2),
>                                                    CyclicGroup(3))));;
gap> DrawOrbitPicture(PSL2Z,[0,1],20,512,512,false,fail,
>                     "~/rcwa/pictures/example1.bmp");
</pre>

<p class = "normaltext">
  The second picture shows three orbits under that action of PSL(2,Z) on Z&nbsp;x&nbsp;Z,
  in different colors:
</p>

<img src = "pictures/example2.png" width = "512" height = "512"
     alt = "An illustration of some orbits under a certain action of PSL(2,Z) on Z x Z" border = "0pt" />

<p class = "normaltext">
  This picture is created by the following command:
</p>

<pre>
gap> DrawOrbitPicture(PSL2Z,Combinations([1..4],2),20,512,512,true,
>                     [[255,0,0],[0,255,0],[0,0,255]],
>                     "~/rcwa/pictures/example2.bmp");
</pre>

<p class = "normaltext">
  The third picture shows the distance of points from (0,1), in terms of length of
  words in the generators, under the above action of PSL(2,Z). The color is determined
  by the distance (mod&nbsp;3):
</p>

<img src = "pictures/example3.png" width = "512" height = "512"
     alt = "An illustration of an orbit under an action of PSL(2,Z) on Z x Z" border = "0pt" />

<p class = "normaltext">
  This picture is created by the following command:
</p>

<pre>
gap> DrawOrbitPicture(PSL2Z,[0,1],20,256,256,true,
>                     [[255,0,0],[0,255,0],[0,0,255]],
>                     "~/rcwa/pictures/example3.bmp");
</pre>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  Afterwards, the picture has been enlarged by a factor of&nbsp;2 by a standard graphics program,
  in order to improve the visibility of the colors of the pixels.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  The following picture shows the same, but with a free product of two cyclic groups
  of order&nbsp;3 instead of PSL(2,Z):

  The next picture shows the distance of points from (0,1), in terms of length of
