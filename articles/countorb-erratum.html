  Erratum for: Counting the Orbits on Finite Simple Groups under the
  Action of the Automorphism&nbsp;Group - Suzuki&nbsp;Groups vs. Linear&nbsp;Groups
</h1>

<p class = "normaltext">
  The typesetter has permuted the numbers of the references in the text.
  To get the number as given in the bibliography, take the image
  of the number given in the text under the permutation
  (1 15 5 6 2 17 9 3 14 4 20 11 13 10)(7 21)(8 16 18 12).
  Some further minor errors were introduced during the typesetting process as well.
  All errors are fixed in the version provided for download on this site.
