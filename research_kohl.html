<h2> Recent Results </h2>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  I have found and investigated a countable simple group, which is built upon
  the arithmetical structure of the ring of integers:
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  Given a pair ( <em>r_1</em>(<em>m_1</em>), <em>r_2</em>(<em>m_2</em>) ) of disjoint
  residue classes of the integers, let the corresponding <em>class transposition</em>
  be the permutation of&nbsp;<b>Z</b> which interchanges <em>r_1</em>+<em>km_1</em>
  and <em>r_2</em>+<em>km_2</em> for each integer&nbsp;<em>k</em> and which fixes
  all other points. Then our group is generated by the set of all class transpositions.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  This group - call it CT(<b>Z</b>) - has a rich class of subgroups --
  it contains finitely generated groups which do not have finite presentations,
  and such for which the membership problem is algorithmically undecidable.
  Further it contains an uncountable family of simple groups, which is parametrized
  by the sets of odd primes.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  Nevertheless, the group CT(<b>Z</b>) permits explicit computations.
  In fact, computational investigations played a crucial role in finding
  the mentioned and many more results.

  So far, I have given invited talks on this subject in Bielefeld (Germany),
  Lausanne (Switzerland), Galway (Ireland), Brussels (Belgium) and
  Braunschweig (Germany).

<h2> Work in Progress </h2>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  The construction described above can be generalized to a much wider class of rings.
  In particular I am presently interested in the structure of the groups RCWA(<b>Z</b>^<em>n</em>)
  which are formed by all <em>residue-class-wise affine</em> permutations of&nbsp;<b>Z</b>^<em>n</em>,
  and in the structure of the groups CT(<b>Z</b>^<em>n</em>) &lt; RCWA(<b>Z</b>^<em>n</em>)
  which are generated by the <em>class transpositions</em> of&nbsp;<b>Z</b>^<em>n</em>.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  A permutation &sigma; of <b>Z</b>^<em>n</em> is said to be <em>residue-class-wise affine</em> if there
  is a lattice&nbsp;<em>L</em> such that &sigma; is affine on any residue class modulo&nbsp;<em>L</em>.
  A <em>class transposition</em> of&nbsp;<b>Z</b>^<em>n</em> interchanges two disjoint residue classes
  modulo two possibly distinct lattices. For example, given two disjoint residue classes
  <em>r_1</em> + <em>v_1</em>&nbsp;<b>Z</b> + <em>v_2</em>&nbsp;<b>Z</b> and
  <em>r_2</em> + <em>w_1</em>&nbsp;<b>Z</b> + <em>w_2</em>&nbsp;<b>Z</b> of&nbsp;<b>Z</b>^2, the corresponding
  class transposition interchanges <em>r_1</em> + <em>k_1</em> <em>v_1</em> + <em>k_2</em> <em>v_2</em>
  and <em>r_2</em> + <em>k_1</em> <em>w_1</em> + <em>k_2</em> <em>w_2</em>
  for any integers <em>k_1</em> and&nbsp;<em>k_2</em>.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  It looks likely that many of the results on RCWA(<b>Z</b>) and CT(<b>Z</b>) can be
  proved in very similar ways for RCWA(<b>Z</b>^<em>n</em>) and CT(<b>Z</b>^<em>n</em>) as well.
  A particular incentive for looking at RCWA(<b>Z</b>^2) is the following:
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  The famous 3<em>n</em>+1 conjecture asserts that iterated application of the Collatz mapping
  T: <em>n</em> -> (<em>n</em>/2 if <em>n</em> is even, (3<em>n</em>+1)/2 if <em>n</em>
  is odd) to any positive integer yields&nbsp;1 after a finite number of steps.
  The mapping&nbsp;T itself is not injective, but dealing with bijective mappings of that type
  is usually much easier. The following permutation of&nbsp;<b>Z</b>^2 acts on the first coordinate
  just like&nbsp;T:
</p>

<p class = "display">
  <img src = "formulas/sigma_t.png" width = "576" height = "83" alt = "A permutation of Z^2"/>
</p>

<p class = "normaltext">
  Now, the 3<em>n</em>+1 conjecture is equivalent to the assertion that the line <em>n</em>=4
  is a set of representatives for the cycles of this permutation on the half-plane <em>n</em>&gt;0.
  However, nice results and the ways to obtain them can usually not be predicted, and therefore
  I stop my description here.
