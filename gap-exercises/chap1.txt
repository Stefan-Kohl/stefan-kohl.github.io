  [1X1.1-1 [33X[0;0YExercise[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [13Xderived  subgroup[113X  [22XG'[122X of a group [22XG[122X is defined as the group [13Xgenerated[113X by
  all  [13Xcommutators[113X  [22X[a,b]  :=  a^-1b^-1ab[122X,  where [22Xa,b âˆˆ G[122X. In general, not all
  elements  of  the  derived  subgroup  of  a  group  are actually commutators
  themselves.  Find  a group [22XG[122X of smallest possible order such that the set of
  all commutators of elements of [22XG[122X does not [13Xform[113X a group![133X
  
  
  [1X1.1-2 [33X[0;0YHints[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YCommutators  can be computed by the operation [10XComm[110X, and the derived subgroup
  can be computed by the operation [10XDerivedSubgroup[110X. The function [10XCartesian[110X and
  the operations [10XSet[110X and [10XAsList[110X can be helpful in this context as well. If you
  are  lazy  but patient, you may simply use [10XCommutatorLength[110X. Otherwise, this
  exercise  requires  writing  a couple of lines of [5XGAP[105X code. The wanted group
  has order greater thanÂ 50, but less thanÂ 100.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  exercise  is  slightly  more difficult than that given in SectionÂ [14X1.1[114X.
  Useful   functions   and   operations   are   [10XAllGroups[110X,  [10XAutomorphismGroup[110X,
  [10XIsInnerAutomorphism[110X, [10XIsConjugate[110X, [10XImage[110X and [10XAsList[110X. It is a good exercise to
  try to find a way to write down the group and the automorphism in a nice and
  human-readable form. One possible way to achieve this is to determine a [21Xnice[121X
  permutation  representation of the group, and to choose an automorphism with
  the desired property which fixes all but one of the generators.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  is  more  or  less  just  an easy programming exercise, which does not
  require  particular  mathematical  knowledge.  Use  the  function [10XNullMat[110X to
  create  a  zero matrix over the field with two elements, and use this matrix
  as  a grid to draw the spiral. The [5XRCWA[105X packageÂ [Koh07b] provides a function

  [33X[0;0YThe  automorphisms  of  a  finite  projective  plane  are  determined by the
  permutations of the set of points which move lines to lines. Thus, labelling
  the  points  with  integers  [22X1,  2,  dots,  n[122X, the automorphism group can be
  described as a subgroup of the symmetric group [22XS_n[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  smallest  projective  plane  has  7  points  and  7 lines. Any point is
  incident  with 3 lines, and any line is incident with 3 points. We label the
  points with integers [22X1, 2, dots, 7[122X. Then the lines are given by the sets [22Xg_1

  [33X[0;0YGiven  a positive integer [22Xn[122X, let rad([22Xn[122X) denote the product of distinct prime
  divisors            ofÂ [22Xn[122X.            The            abc           conjecture
  ([7Xhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture[107X)  states  that  for  any  [22XÏµ > 0[122X
  there is a constant [22XK_Ïµ[122X such that for any triple [22X(a,b,c)[122X of coprime positive
  integers satisfying the equation [22Xa + b = c[122X we have [22Xc < K_Ïµ rad(abc)^1 + Ïµ[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  triple  [22X(a,b,c)[122X of coprime integers satisfying [22Xa + b = c[122X is called an [13Xabc
  triple[113X  if  rad([22Xabc[122X)  is less thanÂ [22Xc[122X. An abc triple [22X(a,b,c)[122X is called a [13Xgood[113X
  abc  triple  if  it  satisfies even [22Xln(c)/ln( rad(abc)) > 1.4[122X. The left-hand
  side of the inequality is sometimes called the [13Xratio[113X of the abc triple.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  can  be  shown easily that there are infinitely many abc triples, but if
  the abc conjecture holds, there are only finitely many good abc triples.[133X

  [1X1.6-2 [33X[0;0YHints[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YYou can start by determining all positive integers less than the given bound
  all  of  whose prime factors divide the given radical. This can be done much
  more  efficiently than by the Sieve of Eratosthenes, or even by looping over
  all integers in the range and factoring -- it is easy and very elementary to
  find  out  how.  Then  you  can  loop over all pairs of these integers, test
  whether  they  are coprime and compute the ratio if they are. To compute the
  ratio, you need the operation [10XFloat[110X which converts integers and rationals to
  floating  point  numbers,  and  the  function  [10XLOG_FLOAT[110X  which computes the
  natural logarithm of a floating point number.[133X
