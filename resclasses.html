<h2>
  Abstract
</h2>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  ResClasses is a little <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a>&nbsp;4 package for computing with set-theoretic
  unions of residue classes of the ring of integers.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  The class of sets which ResClasses can deal with includes the open and the
  closed sets in the topology on the integers which is induced by taking the
  set of all residue classes as a basis, as far as the usual restrictions
  imposed by the finiteness of computing resources permit this.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  Similar functionality as for the ring of integers is provided for its
  (semi-)localizations at one or several prime ideals as well as for
  polynomial rings in one variable over a finite field. Special methods are
  available for unions of residue classes with distinguished (`fixed')
  representatives.
</p>

<p class = "lastparagraph">
  The functionality of this package is used in a group theoretical context
  by the <a href = "rcwa.html">RCWA</a> package.
</p>

<h2>
  Manual
</h2>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  The ResClasses manual is available in the following formats:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href = "resclasses/doc/chap0.html">HTML</a> </li>
  <li> <a href = "resclasses/doc/manual.pdf">PDF</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2> Requirements and Installation </h2>

<p class = "normaltext">
  ResClasses can&nbsp;be used on any platform for which <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> is available.
  It requires only a recent <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> installation.
  For details see the <a href = "resclasses/README.resclasses">README</a> file.
  The installation requires only extracting the archive file in the <code>pkg/</code> subdirectory of the
  <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> root directory. To load the package, enter <code>LoadPackage("resclasses");</code> at the <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a> prompt.
</p>
