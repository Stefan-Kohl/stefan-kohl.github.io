  Abstract
</h2>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  FactInt is a <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a>&nbsp;4 package which provides
  implementations of the following methods for factoring integers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Pollard's <em>p</em>-1 </li>
  <li> Williams' <em>p</em>+1 </li>
  <li> Elliptic Curves Method (ECM) </li>
  <li> Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC) </li>
  <li> Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS) </li>
</ul>

<p class = "firstparagraph">
  FactInt also makes use of
  <a href = "http://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/factors.html" target = "_blank">Richard P. Brent's tables</a>
  of known factors of integers of the form <em>b<sup>k</sup>+/-1</em> for `small' <em>b</em>.
  The code for accessing these tables has been contributed by <a href = "http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/index.html" target = "_blank">Frank L&uuml;beck</a>.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  The ECM is suited best for finding factors which are neither too small
  (i.e. have less than about 12 decimal digits) nor too close to the square root
  of the number to be factored.
  The MPQS is designed for factoring products of two primes of comparable orders
  of magnitude. CFRAC is the historical predecessor of the MPQS.
  Pollard's <em>p</em>-1 and Williams' <em>p</em>+1 are useful for finding factors
  <em>p</em> such that all prime factors of <em>p</em>-1 resp. <em>p</em>+1 are
  `small', e.g. smaller than 1000000.
  All factoring methods implemented in this package are probabilistic.
  In particular the time needed by the ECM depends highly on the actual - good
  or bad - luck.
</p>

<p class = "middleparagraph">
  FactInt provides a general-purpose factorization routine which uses an appropriate
  combination of the methods mentioned above, the Pollard&nbsp;Rho routine which is
  implemented in the <a href = "http://www.gap-system.org" target = "_blank">GAP</a>&nbsp;Library and a variety of tricks for special cases
  to obtain a good average performance for `arbitrary' integers.
  At the user's option, FactInt provides detailed information about
  the progress of the factorization process.
